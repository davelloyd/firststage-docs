# Cameras

FirstStage provides a powerful camera system. Cameras can be easily created with the Viewfinder and then animated with complex motion paths. Cameras can automatically look at targets and follow targets (the two targets do not need to be the same).

You can create cameras by going to the [Asset Library](basics/asset-library.md) and choosing the **Basic Camera** but the best way to create cameras is usually to use the Viewfinder:

{% content-ref url="basics/core-tools/viewfinder.md" %}
[viewfinder.md](basics/core-tools/viewfinder.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Go to Cameras on the Wristpad to view all the cameras in the scene.

All the cameras in the scene are shown in a column on the left. Click on a camera to show it in the main panel.

You can click on the main panel to enter the TTL space for that camera.

If you click the **Inspect** button on a camera, it will take you to the Cameras panel with that camera selected.
