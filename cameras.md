# Cameras

FirstStage provides a powerful camera system. Cameras can be easily created with the Viewfinder and then animated with complex motion paths. Cameras can automatically look at targets and follow targets (the two targets do not need to be the same).

## Using the Viewfinder <a href="#_gi37kx4aa5b" id="_gi37kx4aa5b"></a>

You can summon a hand-held Viewfinder by pointing your controller at your head and pressing the A or Menu button. You can also summon it directly from the Tool Wheel.

The Viewfinder screen shows what the camera is seeing through the lens.

### Lens Controls <a href="#_6ayqyihy0vzk" id="_6ayqyihy0vzk"></a>

On the left hand side, there are three levers which allow you to adjust the focus, lens and aperture.

The depth-of-field blurring is a real-time approximation and will not give large bokeh.

### Setting the Target <a href="#_fvczo6lrall6" id="_fvczo6lrall6"></a>

The camera will autofocus if it has a target. If you touch the trigger, it will set the target to whatever is at the centre of the screen. While continuing to touch the trigger, the target is held and you can then frame it so the target is anywhere in the field of view.

## Creating a Camera <a href="#_98phf9w4wevz" id="_98phf9w4wevz"></a>

Click the trigger to create a camera from the current viewpoint. There will then be a camera in front of you.

You can also click & hold the trigger to record handheld camera motion. When you do, the scene will start recording and activities will play out. There is a small amount of smoothing but this is not a steadicam.

## Cameras on the Wristpad <a href="#_yjzp7fnhledc" id="_yjzp7fnhledc"></a>

Go to Cameras on the Wristpad to view all the cameras in the scene.

All the cameras in the scene are shown in a column on the left. Click on a camera to show it in the main panel.

You can click on the main panel to enter the TTL space for that camera.

If you click the **Inspect** button on a camera, it will take you to the Cameras panel with that camera selected.
