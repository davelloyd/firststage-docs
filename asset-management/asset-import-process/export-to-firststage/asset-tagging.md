# Asset Tagging

The FirstStage Asset Tagging template has been created to provide a structured set of tags that can be applied to any asset, to allow them to be more easily found in FirstStageâ€™s Asset Browser. This is not a definitive taxonomy, just a guide.

To use it as a guide, select a top level category, then add tags for each appropriate term within that category.
