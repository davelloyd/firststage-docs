# Set up Unity

Moviestorm FirstStage is built on the Unity Game Engine. As a result, all asset imports are organised using the [Unity Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html).

## Install Unity

FirstStage uses the 2020 (LTS) version of the Unity engine. The easiest way to locate that version is via the [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).

### Install the Unity Hub

The Unity Hub is a management tool that allows you to manage all of your Unity projects and installations, and to manage multiple installations of the Unity Editor along with their associated components, in order to create new Projects, and open existing Projects.

* Go to the [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) webpage
* Click on the Download Unity Hub button and follow the installation instructions
* At the end of installation, run the Unity Hub (you will also be able to launch it from your Start Menu/Unity Hub)

### Sign in to Unity with your Unity ID

In order to use the Hub, you will need to create an account with Unity if you do not already have one.

* Click on the Unity ID profile icon and select Sign in
* Fill out the form and click the Sign in button\
  If you do not have a Unity ID …
* Click on the link in ‘If you don't have a Unity ID, please create one.’
* Fill out the form details as instructed and click on the Create a Unity ID button, then Sign in

### Install Unity version 2020.3.41

1. Select the Installs section and click the Add button to launch the ‘Add Unity Version’ pop up
2. Select ‘Unity 2020 (LTS)’ in the list of Latest Official Releases and click Next
3. Click Done

_NB - No additional modules are required, but we recommend that you keep the default selected ‘Documentation’ module._

This will start downloading and installing Unity onto your PC.

_NB - If you had already installed Unity you can skip most of these steps but make sure you do have the right version of Unity installed._

## Prepare the FirstStage Asset Importer project

The next step is download our Asset Importer template project for importing assets from [HERE](https://firststage.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Asset+Importer.zip).

1. **Download** the Asset Importer.zip file
2. **Unzip** this into a suitable local location.

We would NOT recommend selecting a network drive as there is a lot of data to read, or in a cloud sync’d area such as G-Drive.

## Add the Asset Importer project to Unity

This will simplify adding assets to local or cloud based FirstStage projects

1. Go back to the Unity Hub and select the Projects section and click the Add button
2. Navigate to where you unzipped the Asset Importer project and select that folder.
3. Now that the Asset Importer is in the Projects list, click on it to start the Unity Editor.
4. Go here for a basic [understanding of the Unity Editor](https://firststage.moviestorm.co.uk/knowledgebase/unity-basics/)

{% hint style="info" %}
You should now have an entry for ‘Asset Importer’ under your Projects. In the Unity Version column, select the version we just installed (it will be the only one unless you have previous versions of Unity installed) to launch it.
{% endhint %}

_You can also launch the Editor from your Start Menu, under Unity_
