This guide will illustrate how to source assets and import them into the Unity Editor to prepare for export to your FirstStage repository:

* Unity Asset Store
* Sketchup
* 3DS Max & Maya

### 1. Unity Asset Store

To help illustrate this process, we have used the free [Old Coin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/old-coin-49530) asset in the Unity Asset Store.

#### 1. Acquire the asset

Log in to the Unity Asset Store website.

As a free item, instead of ‘Add to Cart’ and having to go through the purchase process, it already displays the ‘Add to My Assets’ button.

1. In the Asset Store website, click Add to My Assets.
2. The page will refresh after a pop-up. Click Open in Unity.\
   This will open the same page in the Asset Store tab in the Unity Editor.

_NB - You can browse the Unity Asset Store from inside the Unity Editor, in which case there will be no need to Add to My Assets or Open in Unity._

#### 2. Import to the Unity Editor

We can download the asset directly from within the Unity Editor and import it into our Asset Importer project.

1. In the Asset Store window (top right as standard), click Download. This will download the asset data to your Asset Importer folder.
2. The window will refresh. Click Import to launch the Unity Import Package window.\
   NB - If you download the scene or asset file outside of the Unity Editor, you can import it by clicking on File > Open Scene in the Unity Editor menu to launch the Unity Import Package window.
3. In the Unity Import Package window you should see the selected asset package and it’s parts expanded and selected, click Import.\
   If they are not all selected, click All, then click Import and the Unity Import Package window will close.
4. After processing, you will now see the asset package listed in it’s own ‘Japanese Coin’ folder in the Project window (bottom left as standard).\
   NB - Installing large asset packages may take some time. You should check the Console window (bottom right as standard) for any errors
