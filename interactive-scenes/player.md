# Player

The **Player** is the entry point for interactive scenes. You can create one from the [Asset Library](../basics/asset-library.md) under the **Interactive** tag. Place it where you want the player to start.

To become a player, point at the Player thing with the [Navigator](../basics/core-tools/navigator.md) and pull the trigger to Take Control.

Being a player is similar to being a [performer](../animation/performance-capture/performing.md):&#x20;

* You are teleported to whether the player thing was standing and with its facing.
* Your hands can only interact with designated things such as Multiple Choice Dialogs or Holdable props.
* You do not have access to the [WristPad](../basics/wristpad/) or any of the [Core Tools](../basics/core-tools/).
* Time starts recording immediately: activities will play out around you.
* Quit being a player by pressing both Menu buttons at once.

If you start FirstStage as a player, you will automatically take control of the first Player thing in the scene.
