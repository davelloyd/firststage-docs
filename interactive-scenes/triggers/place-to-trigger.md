# Place To Trigger

To use a Place to Trigger asset, do the following:

* Fetch a 'Place to Trigger' trigger from the Asset Library, and place it on stage.
* Also fetch an asset from the Asset Library, and place it next to the trigger.

To associate that trigger with that asset:

* Hold down the Action button (Y or B button) for the Grabber, and choose the Anchor.
* Using the Grabber, point at the anchor (an orange ball within the asset), hold down the trigger and drag the connecting line to the red ball of the Place to Trigger. When you are pointing at the right place, the connecting line with go green. Release the trigger.

You have now made that asset a trigger, and you can now move the asset to another place in your scene. The player will need to place the correct asset into the it's trigger ghost to trigger the event. In this case it will be successfully crossing an requirement off the checklist.

Repeat the set up of more Place to Trigger events.

Now go to the Asset Library and fetch a Checklist, and place it on set in a suitable position (this may be visible for the player to see what they need to do, or hidden somewhere if you prefer the player not to know exactly what they need to do.

Click on the Edit icon (a pencil) for the Checklist, and fill in the form:

* Give the Checklist a title or description, such as "Find all the assets to open the door."
* Add tasks to list the assets that have been used for Place to Trigger events.

You now need to connect the Place to Trigger events to the Checklist. Simply:

* Click on the trigger event icon for the first Place to Trigger task. This will cue the trigger event on the timeline. Now click on the associated task in the Checklist.
* Repeat for all required  Place to Trigger events.

The Checklist now needs all the listed tasks to be completed, before it can action it's own trigger, which in this case could be animating a door to open to allow the player to progress, or a new tool to unhide for the player to add to their Backpack.

Create the Checklist event as required, e.g. see [Rigid Animation](../../animation/rigid-animation/)
