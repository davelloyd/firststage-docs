# Trigger Volume

There are several versions of this with different shapes of volume but they all work the same way: when the player enters the volume, the branch is triggered and plays out.

When authoring, a simple control panel will popup when you point at the trigger volume (same as for Click to Trigger).

When playing, the trigger volume will also act as a teleport target. Once triggered the volume will change colour to orange instead of cyan.
