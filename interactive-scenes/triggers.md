# Triggers

## Click to Trigger <a href="#_cnqemdvg2jfz" id="_cnqemdvg2jfz"></a>

This is one of the simplest types of triggers. Anchor it to any thing in the scene to make that thing interactive.

When authoring, a simple control panel will popup when you point at the trigger.

* The Cue button will cue the branch at the current time just as if the branch had been triggered by the player.
* The Untrigger button will reset the branch so it is untriggered and any activities in the branch will no longer play or be visible on the Timeline.

When playing, the thing will highlight when pointed at and clicking on it will trigger its branch. Once triggered, the thing will no longer highlight.

## Trigger Volume <a href="#_d97xm9hot79u" id="_d97xm9hot79u"></a>

There are several versions of this with different shapes of volume but they all work the same way: when the player enters the volume, the branch is triggered and plays out.

When authoring, a simple control panel will popup when you point at the trigger volume (same as for Click to Trigger).

When playing, the trigger volume will also act as a teleport target. Once triggered the volume will change colour to orange instead of cyan.
