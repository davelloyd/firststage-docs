# Mocap with Rokoko Smartsuit

FirstStage supports the [Rokoko Electronics](https://www.rokoko.com/en) Smartsuit for high quality motion capture.

1. **Install the Rokoko Studio application**\
   Make sure the Smartsuit is working in Studio first.
2. **Enable Forward data**\
   From the Settings menu (gear icon, top left of Studio), go to Data streaming and enable Forward data, and set Forward port to 14043.\
   _NB - If Studio and FirstStage are running on different computers, set the Forward IP to that of the computer running FirstStage._

You may also need to disable Windows Firewall to allow Studio and FirstStage to communicate.
