# Performance Capture

FirstStage supports a variety of methods for capturing performance on humanoid characters:

* You can use your tracked headset & controllers (and optional feet & waist trackers) to capture bulk body motion.
* You can use an iPhone that supports FaceAR to capture facial expressions
* You can connect a Rokoko Smartsuit to FirstStage for more accurate and detailed body motion

Please contact us if you want to connect other mocap devices to FirstStage such as Optitrack or Leap Motion (for hands) or Move.ai, etc.
