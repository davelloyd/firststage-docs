# Posing Characters

Proximity grab a puppet and you can move specific body parts to create poses.

For a humanoid, there are body parts to represent the following bones in the skeleton:

* Chest
  * Head
  * Bicep (Upper Arm)
    * Forearm (Lower Arm)
      * Hand
  * Thigh (Upper Leg)
    * Calf (Lower Leg)
      * Foot

To pose a puppet, with the Grabber selected:

* Move your hand into the puppet until a body part is highlighted in yellow.
* Press and hold the Trigger to grab the body part and move it, then release to set that position.

_Tip - Pose the body parts down the bone hierarchy to avoid having to re-pose body parts that can be affected by the movement of body parts further up the hierarchy._\
_E.g Move the chest first to create the rough pose, then the bicep, then the forearm, and finally the hand._

_NB - Distance grab a puppet to create rigid animations_
