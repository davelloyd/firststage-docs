# Release 8

## Update (a)

* Improved behaviour when placing assets and snapping to floor and touching objects
* New handles for precise movement and rotation of a thing
* Improvements to the Sketch tool:
  * Wireframe shows when geometry can be manipulated
  * When pulling faces, there is now a default 15 degree snap which can be overriden with the grip button.
  * When pulling a face, you can also choose to move the vertices of the face not just the plane
* When pulling a face, you can extrude that face to create new geometry.
* Sketches can be moved by using the handle selector on the Grabber tool.
* New procedural “Lathe” object allowing interesting surfaces of revolution to be created
* New procedural “Stairs” object which keeps the step height constant and changes number of steps with height
* Select tool now uses a “sphere” select method.
* Selected objects can be moved, deleted or cloned as a group.
* The Duplicator now includes a Grid clone mode
* New movement controls using both grip buttons allowing move, climb and turn as well as scale.

## Update (b)

* Fixed issue with Sketch tool not working due to missing shader.
