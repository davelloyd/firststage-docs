# Release 22

## New Console Room

* We now have a much more stylish console room that replaces the old Office that you used to start in.
* This is also used when browsing for assets and when working Through The Lens with cameras.

## Introduction Tutorial

* When you first start on set, you are now offered a tutorial which will take you through:
  * Familiarising yourself with the controllers
    * Moving around the set
  * Selecting and placing assets
  * Capturing mocap performances
  * Using the WristPad
  * Using the Timeline
  * Creating and working with cameras
* More tutorials will be added soon!

## Hints & Tips

* As we work through our beta phase, we’re scrabbling to get the documentation together and update several years of stale tutorials – most of which is available via the web browser on your WristPad. But who wants to read documentation anyway? To help you while you’re working, we are adding a lot of hints and tips in context.

## Fixes

* A lot of stalls when working collaboratively have been eliminated.
* Many cases where cutting holes in shapes would lead to broken geometry have been fixed.
