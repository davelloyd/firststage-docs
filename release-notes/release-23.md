# Release 23

## Grabbing by proximity

* Regardless of which tool you have selected on your controller, if you reach into an object you can now grab it directly.
* Your controller will turn into a gloved hand to indicate you can grab: pull the trigger and move it in exactly the same way you would from a distance with the Grabber tool.

## Posing Puppets

* It is now much easier to pose puppets:
  * You no longer need to use the “?” action to enable the pose handles
  * Simply reach into any part of the puppet’s body and you will get a glowing handle for that body part.
  * Your controller will also turn into a gloved hand to indicate you can grab.
  * Grab the body part to move it.

## Improved workflow for VR Mocap

* You only need to measure your height once: this is then stored as part of your profile.
* If you need to measure your height again, you can by pressing the Recalibrate button on the left.
* You now have a choice of 3 modes: Standing, Sitting and Prone.

## Stage Machinery for the Linz Theater

More stage machinery is now supported on the Linz Theater stage:

* 3 raisers, complete with separate lift platform
* Portal bridge and towers
* Orchestra pit
