# Release 35

## Space Brush

FirstStage now incorporates the OpenBrush (originally TiltBrush) tool.&#x20;

This has been open sourced, so why try to recreate greatness! Within FirstStage, we call it Space Brush to avoid confusion with the original standalone tool. The Space Brush can be found directly on the WristPad.

## ReadyPlayerMe Characters

FirstStage now supports ReadyPlayerMe character creation.&#x20;

You can create characters from a wide variety of faces and costumes: go into the Asset Browser, select the Character tag and then select the ReadyPlayerMe tag.&#x20;

If you sign up with ReadyPlayerMe you can create characters on their website for use inside FirstStage as well as getting access to a wider collection of costumes and bling (but some items may cost).
