# Release 28

Release 28 has mostly focussed on a lot of bug fixes and quality of life improvements. But R28 also includes substantial improvements to the Script view that make it much easier to take an initial screenplay and plan out a scene.

## Script View

* Paste plain text into script blocks
* Split text into dialog and action lines
* Edit script lines and navigate around the script
* Script blocks show at the bottom of the timeline
* Moving a script block on the timeline moves all activities that start in that block along the timeline as well
* Cue an activity to start at a given time from the script view

## Other Improvements

* Each character now has a default “Voice” audio source accessible from the Audio panel.
* Support for importing characters from Reallusion Character Creator.
