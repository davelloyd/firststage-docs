# Installing on Quest (Standalone)

{% hint style="danger" %}
BETA RELEASE
{% endhint %}

FirstStage is not yet publicly available on the Meta App Store (yet) but we invite you to try our beta release. It has most of the same functionality as the PC release but may have issues specific to running standalone on the headset itself.

## Installing FirstStage

You can get access to FirstStage by clicking the link below. Then click Join to join the Beta channel.

If you now start your Quest headset and look in your Apps, you will find FirstStage. If it hasn't already installed, click on it to do so.

When you first start FirstStage, you will be asked for permission to access features of your headset. These are:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="206"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>File Storage</td><td>Access to the file storage on the quest is needed to import images, video, sounds etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Microphone</td><td>This is needed so you can talk to collaborators on your project and also if you want to record dialogue.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Once FirstStage starts you will need to login: you can use either your FirstStage user account or your Meta Quest account.

## _Notes_

_Standalone Quest devices are nowhere near as powerful as a typical PC, so the graphical quality may not seem as high fidelity as when using PCVR via SteamLink. For example, lighting is much more limited._&#x20;

_However, FirstStage has been optimised for the Quest and works well. If you are careful with how many assets you use, and their complexity, you can make very effective scenes._
