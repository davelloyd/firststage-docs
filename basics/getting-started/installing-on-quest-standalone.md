  Here we describe how to install FirstStage directly on an Oculus Quest (2, 3,
  or Pro) instead of running it on a PC via AirLink.

# Installing on Quest (Standalone)

{% hint style="danger" %}
EARLY BETA
{% endhint %}

FirstStage is not on the Oculus store (yet), so you will also need the following:

* Sidequest running on a PC
* A Meta account with developer access
* The Oculus app running on a phone
* Enable Developer mode on your Quest

## SideQuest

This PC application is used to load FirstStage directly onto your headset.

Download and from the link below. You will want the **Advanced Installer**:

## Meta Account

You should already have a Meta account that you used to set up your Quest. You now need to make that a developer account.

If you start SideQuest and click on **OPEN SETUP INSTRUCTIONS** there is a HowTo for doing this (with a little video to help).

Or you can go directly to:

## Oculus App

Now that you have developer status, open the Oculus app on your mobile phone: it should be easy to find on either the Apple or Android stores and you may well have already installed it as part of setting up your Quest.

Go to the **Settings** tab and select your headset. Then go to **More Settings** and there should be a switch for **Developer Mode**. Turn that on.

It usually helps to reboot your headset at this point to activate developer mode.

## Installing FirstStage

Connect your Quest to your PC with the USB cable. If you look in your headset, you should see it asking for permission for the connected device to access files and enable debugging. Click on **Allow**.

Download FirstStage from here:

Now go to SideQuest and click on the icon (top right row in the middle) to **Install APK file from folder on computer** and then select FirstStage.apk from where you downloaded it to.

## Starting FirstStage

Once FirstStage is installed on your Quest, stick your headset on and go to the **App Library** (far right of the main menu bar).

Click on the **Search Apps** field at the top.

Top right, click on the dropdown showing **All** and select **Unknown Sources**.

You should see FirstStage in the list: click to start.

You will now need to login with your FirstStage user account.

Please wait while FirstStage downloads the asset bundles and then you will be in the Office.

## Notes

The Quest devices are nowhere near as powerful as a typical PC: lighting is much more limited: we usually cannot afford shadows or much in the way of post processing like ambient occlusion.&#x20;

However FirstStage has been optimised for the Quest and works well. If you are careful with how many assets you use, you can make very effective scenes.
