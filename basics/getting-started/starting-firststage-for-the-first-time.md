# Starting FirstStage for the first time

Once you have your VR rig properly set up with Steam, you can launch FirstStage.

## Log in

First, you will need to log in with the credentials for your user account.&#x20;

## Create your first Project

Next you will see the **Projects** screen. As this is the first time, you won't have one so click on the **Create** button.

For your first scene, choose the **Empty Stage**.

## Run through the Tutorial

The first time you go on set, you will be presented with a brief tutorial. You can dismiss it at any point, but it is well worth going through it from start to finish. Once you have completed the tutorial, it won't show again until you go to the **Preferences** section on the **WristPad** and click on the **Restart Tutorial** button.

The tutorial will introduce you to the following aspects of FirstStage:

* Your controllers and how to use them
* Tools and the Tool Wheel
* Teleporting with the Navigator
* Tool Radial Menus
* Moving around the set
* Browsing and Placing Assets
* Proximity Grabber
* Using handles and the Waldo
* Character Performance
* WristPad
* Timeline
* Cameras

## You're ready to play!

This documentation is available on your WristPad in VR.&#x20;
