# Controllers

Familiarise yourself with the controllers before you get started and make sure you are comfortable with the buttons.

## Basic Controls

The following gives you an idea how the different controls on your controller are used:

| Control                               | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trigger                               | <p>Pulling the trigger performs the primary action for the tool, e.g. teleporting with the Navigator, moving something with the Grabber, etc. <br>Some actions distinguish how far you squeeze the trigger.</p> |
| Menu (Vive), A button (Index, Oculus) | <p>Access the Tool Menu and change tools.<br>Click the Menu Buttons on both controllers at the same time to go to the Asset Library.</p>                                                                        |
| ThumbPad (Vive, Index)                | Tracks the position of your thumb and usually controls a radial menu of up to four options - left, right, top and bottom.                                                                                       |
| ThumbStick (Index, Oculus)            | As the ThumbPad, usually controls a radial menu acting like a d-pad.                                                                                                                                            |
| B button (Index, Oculus)              | <p>Usually provides a direct binding to the Inspect Menu. Vive users will find Inspect in the Grabber radial menu. </p><p>On flat UI components will open a popup menu.</p>                                     |
| Grip                                  | <p>Primarily used to <a href="../moving-around/">move around the stage</a>.<br>In some contexts, clicking the grip button will toggle alternative behaviour for the current action. </p>                        |

{% hint style="info" %}
The grip can be an awkward button to locate, but with 1st finger on the trigger you should find it on the side of the controller under your 2nd & 3rd fingertips (Vive) and 2nd,3rd & 4th fingertips (Index).
{% endhint %}

### Other Buttons

The System Menu button is not used by FirstStage (except to wake the controllers).
