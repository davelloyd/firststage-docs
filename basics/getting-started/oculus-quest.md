* Using your controllers, point at the clock area on the Task Bar and click to enter Quick Settings
* Use the Wi-Fi panel to connect to the internet via your wi-fi

* If by PC Link cable, you should see your PC already listed
* If by Air Link, you will need to turn on the Air Link switch to see your PC listed.
* Select your PC and click Launch

* This should automatically start up Steam, and you should arrive at the FirstStage login screen
