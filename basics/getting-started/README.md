# Getting Started

You will need:

* A VR capable PC: the more powerful, the better for complex scenes!
* A VR headset and controllers: any SteamVR capable headset such as Vive, Index or Oculus Rift, but also Oculus Quest 2/3/Pro

These are the steps you neeed to get going with FirstStage:

If you want to run FirstStage directly on a Quest (Beta!), follow these instructions:

## Set up SteamVR

If you have a Vive or an Index headset, SteamVR will be installed while setting up your headset.

if you are using another headset such as the Meta Quest 2 or do not have SteamVR installed, you can get it here:

{% hint style="info" %}
Oculus Quest 2 users also need to set up the PC Link: [instructions here](setting-up-a-quest-headset.md). This allows the Quest to act as a PC VR headset instead of running content standalone.
{% endhint %}

## Start FirstStage

You should now be ready to start FirstStage and create a scene!
