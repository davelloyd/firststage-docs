# Undo / Redo

FirstStage keeps a stack of every operation as you edit the scene. You can undo operations as far back as when you entered the scene and redo them all the way forward again should you want.

Undo/Redo gives you the confidence to try things out and roll back if it is doesn't work.

## Undo History

The Undo History can be reviewed on the [WristPad](wristpad/): the screen shows a list of edits in order going back in time to the start of the session. Each edit will have a brief description, such as "Create Chair" or "Delete Mocap".

You can click on edit to rewind back to it or forward to it.
