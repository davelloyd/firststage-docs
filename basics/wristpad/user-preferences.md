# User Preferences

You will find User Preferences on the Wristpad under the Preferences icon. From here you can adjust how FirstStage works to your preference.

Comfort settings to reduce any VR-induced motion sickness whilst moving around the scene include:

* Flatten outside world inside asset browser or camera
* Scale in steps
* Turn in steps
* Climb in steps
* Blink when stepping\
  _NB - This can also help reduce motion sickness but may be uncomfortable if you are vulnerable to strobe effects_

Your preferences are saved in the cloud and will be used on whichever device you are logged in on.
