# WristPad

Look at the back of your wrist and the WristPad will reveal itself (your thumb will be pointing towards you). It is a virtual tablet that provides lots of useful functions with a familiar flat-screen interface (mostly).

The **Home Screen** shows an array of buttons that will open the main screens.

These screens and how to use them are described later in context.&#x20;

## Detaching a Screen

You can grab one of the handles at the edge of the WristPad to detach a screen and drag it somewhere in your work area. To get rid of the screen, use the Destroyer.
