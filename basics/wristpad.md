# WristPad

Look at the back of your wrist and the WristPad will reveal itself (your thumb will be pointing towards you). It is a virtual tablet that provides lots of useful functions with a familiar flat-screen interface (mostly).

The **Home Screen** shows an array of buttons that will open the main screens.

These screens and how to use them are described later in context.&#x20;
