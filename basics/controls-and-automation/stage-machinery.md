# Stage Machinery \`

Some stages such as the **Linz Landestheater** have various machinery built in and rigged for control.

These include:

* Turntables
* Flybars
* Lighting bars
* Rising tables

The **Stage Controls** desk on the [WristPad](../wristpad/) provides a control strip for each machinery control. Some controls affect height, some affect angle, etc.
