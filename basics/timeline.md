# Timeline

\[DESKTOP IMAGE]

The Timeline holds all the Activities that describe how the scene plays out: performances, animation, automation etc.

The [WristPad](wristpad.md) provides a view on the timeline as does the desktop and several other usages.

## Activities

Activities are a key concept behind FirstStage: they describe the time-like behaviour of things.&#x20;

An activity has a Start Time and a Duration that determine when the activity plays. It is typically represented as a block on the timeline.&#x20;

You can drag an activity along the timeline to change when it happens.

For some activities, you can also stretch the duration or trim/reveal clips: point at the activity to reveal triangular handles at the end and then drag the handle.

If you press the **Inspect** button, a menu will pop up with options depending on the type of activity. One option will always be **Delete**.

## Tracks

Every thing that has an activity will have a track on the timeline.

The track header (left hand column) shows the name of the thing. If you point at it, a menu will pop up with the following options:

* open the [Inspector](working-with-things/inspector.md) on it.
* teleport right next to it.
* enable/disable all activities for it.

## Scrubbing Time

You can scrub time by dragging the background of the Timeline.

You can scroll to anywhere in time using the scrollbar along the top. The arrows at the end of the scrollbar thumb allow you to scale the timeline.

You can also scrub time by using the thumbpad/stick while pointing at the timeline.
