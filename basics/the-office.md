# The Office

When you start FirstStage, the Office is the first space you go to. You can choose to work with it in VR or from the Desktop.

## Virtual Keyboard

Working in VR, there is no physical keyboard (although you can always pop out of VR and use your real keyboard at any time) so FirstStage includes a virtual keyboard.

When you are in The Office, your controllers are mallets with which you can hit the keys on the virtual keyboard. The keyboard includes common symbols but does not yet support accented characters or non-latin characters.

## Returning to the Office

Once on set, you can return to the Office at any time by going into the **Asset Library** and clicking on the big exit button behind you.
