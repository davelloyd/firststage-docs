# Time Tool

The Time Tool has two functions:&#x20;

* the radial menu provides transport controls to control playback as an alternative to using the point & click controls on the [WristPad](../wristpad.md).
* use the trigger to grab things and animate them.

## Animation

You can animate something by pointing at it and pulling the trigger to grab it.&#x20;

A confirmation timer will show before recording of the animation starts.

You can then move the thing with your hand: it will follow as if on a tight spring which helps reduce hand jitter and results in a cleaner motion.

Release the trigger to finish the animation. Recording will stop and a new activity will appear on the timeline.

## Radial Menu

* Record / Pause toggle.
* Rewind to start of scene.
* Advance time by a beat (useful for pose to pose animation).
* Jog / shuttle control: hold and twist wrist to play time forwards/backwards at any speed.
