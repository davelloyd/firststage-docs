# Time Tool

The Time Tool has two functions:&#x20;

* the radial menu provides transport controls to control playback as an alternative to using the point & click controls on the [WristPad](../wristpad.md).
* use the trigger to grab things and animate them.

## Animation

You can animate something by pointing at it and pulling the trigger to grab it.&#x20;

A confirmation timer will show before recording of the animation starts.

You can then move the thing with your hand: it will follow as if on a tight spring which helps reduce hand jitter and results in a cleaner motion.

Release the trigger to finish the animation. Recording will stop and a new activity will appear on the timeline. Play back and it will now animate along the motion path created.

Scaling yourself bigger is beneficial for moving objects further distances, whilst scaling smaller is suited better for moving fine details such as peoples limbs to complete an action.

## Radial Menu

* Record / Pause toggle.
* Rewind to start of scene.
* Advance time by a beat (useful for pose to pose animation).
* Jog / shuttle control: hold and twist wrist to play time forwards/backwards at any speed.
