# Sketcher

The Sketcher lets you create new shapes and work on existing shapes.

See the [Sketching](../../sketching.md) topic for details but here we will just note that the basic operation is to click on a sequence of points in the scene to form a path: a closed path will create a new shape; a path across the face of an existing shape will cut the face.

* Undo & Redo.&#x20;

Note that Undo on the Sketcher will unwind a half-formed path before undoing anything else.

If you change tool before completing a path, the path will be discarded.
