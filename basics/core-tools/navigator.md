# Navigator

The Navigator is the tool for teleporting around the set. It is the default tool on your off hand.

Simply point where you want to jump to and a green target circle will appear. The target circle won't appear if there is no collider or it is not a valid layer.

If you point it at a puppet, instead of teleporting, you will have the option to [Take Control](../../activities/performance-capture/motion-capture-vrik.md) and let you [perform as that puppet](../../activities/performance-capture/motion-capture-vrik.md).

If you point at a camera, instead of teleporting, you can go [Through The Lens](../../camerawork/through-the-lens.md) instead and control the camera's framing and movement throughout the scene.

Other types of taking control may include driving a car, etc.
