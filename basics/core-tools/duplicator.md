# Duplicator

The Duplicator lets you duplicate things. Simply point at the thing you want to duplicate and it will highlight in green if it can be duplicated. Pull the trigger and you will then be holding the newly created copy and can move it around and place it. Keep holding the trigger while you place it.

If you try to duplicate the new copy, you will just move it instead (it will highlight yellow as usual). This is often desirable as placing an object usually takes several steps. Duplicate the original thing if you want another copy.
