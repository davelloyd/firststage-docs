# Tape Measure

The Tape Measure is a simple tool to let you measure distances inside the virtual world. The distance is shown in the Tool Status panel.

If you want to measure the distance between two points, take the end of the controller to the first point, then pull the trigger & hold while moving (and maybe yourself) to the second point.

## Radial Menu

The radial menu for the Tape Measure selects different modes for measuring:

| Mode     | Behaviour                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Forwards | Distance is from the tip of the controller to the end of the pointer beam.                                                                                               |
| Down     | The beam casts downwards (as a plumb bob). Useful for measuring heights.                                                                                                 |
| Sideways | The beam casts left & right perpendicular to the controller. The distance is between the left & right ends of the beam. Useful for measuring the distance between walls. |
