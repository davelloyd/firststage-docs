# Using FirstStage on the Desktop

Working in 3D is much easier in virtual reality than on a flat screen. However there are some functions which work just as well (or even better) on a flat screen that in virtual reality.

FirstStage provides a Desktop interface for these that uses conventional idioms.

The top bar of the desktop view has the following elements (left to right):

* Back button to return to the [Office](the-office.md) and change scene.
* Scene name / Project name
* Menu button to show the functions available on the desktop.
* Show/Hide button to show and hide the desktop panels (allowing you to see the VR view as spectator)

The bottom bar on the desktop is a set of transport controls.

## Desktop Panels

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="222"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="../camerawork/camera-sequencer.md"><strong>Camera Sequencer</strong></a></td><td>This lets you do a 'live' style linear mix of the cameras to a single master track which can then be exported for editing in a full non-linear video editor.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="working-with-time/timeline.md"><strong>Timeline</strong></a></td><td>Presents the activities on the timeline in a linear view similarly to that on the WristPad, but with more space to work.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="working-with-time/script.md"><strong>Script</strong></a></td><td>Presents the activities on the timeline in a vertical view as a script.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="broken-reference"><strong>Motion Capture</strong></a></td><td>Provides desktop control over mocap. Useful for a performance director. Also, the primary interface for facial mocap.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="using-firststage-on-the-desktop.md#collaboration"><strong>Collaboration</strong></a></td><td>A desktop view of the Collaboration screen which helps your team communicate during a session.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Individual panels can be resized by grabbing and dragging their borders in a familiar way. You can hide a panel by clicking on the cross top right.
