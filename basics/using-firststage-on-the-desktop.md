# Using FirstStage on the Desktop

FirstStage is primarily a VR application when it comes to creation. However, the desktop can be used to grab video or images of the user's view in VR, as well as hosting a few other areas of functionality suited to a desktop UI.

### Collaboration

The collaboration screen is to help your team connect in FirstStage sessions. You can:

* See who else in your team is online and message them with voice or text notes.
* Enable or disable speech comms

### Sequencer

The Sequencer is a simple video editing tool that takes it's feed directly from the live cameras in the current FirstStage scene. You can:

* Add cameras to a Master timeline and trim when they start/stop to create a rough edit.
* Export the edit as a video file, or export all the camera footage to edit in the software of your choice.
