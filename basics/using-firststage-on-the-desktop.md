# Using FirstStage on the Desktop

Working in 3D is much easier in virtual reality than on a flat screen. However there are some functions which work just as well (or even better) on a flat screen that in virtual reality.

FirstStage provides a Desktop interface for these that uses conventional idioms.

The top bar of the desktop view has the following elements (left to right):

* Back button to return to the [Office](the-office.md) and change scene.
* Scene name / Project name
* Menu button to show the functions available on the desktop.
* Show/Hide button to show and hide the desktop panels (allowing you to see the VR view as spectator)

The bottom bar on the desktop is a set of transport controls.

## Desktop Panels

| ****[**Camera Sequencer**](../camerawork/camera-sequencer.md)****                                  | This lets you do a 'live' style linear mix of the cameras to a single master track which can then be exported for editing in a full non-linear video editor. |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ****[**Timeline**](timeline.md)****                                                                | Presents the activities on the timeline in a linear view similarly to that on the WristPad, but with more space to work.                                     |
| ****[**Script**](script.md)****                                                                    | Presents the activities on the timeline in a vertical view as a script.                                                                                      |
| ****[**Motion Capture**](../activities/performance-capture/motion-capture-desktop-controls.md)**** | Provides desktop control over mocap. Useful for a performance director. Also, the primary interface for facial mocap.                                        |
| ****[**Collaboration**](using-firststage-on-the-desktop.md#collaboration)****                      | A desktop view of the Collaboration screen which helps your team communicate during a session.                                                               |

Individual panels can be resized by grabbing and dragging their borders in a familiar way. You can hide a panel by clicking on the cross top right.
