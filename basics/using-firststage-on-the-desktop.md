# Using FirstStage on the Desktop

Working in 3D is much easier in virtual reality than on a flat screen. However there are some functions which work just as well (or even better) on a flat screen that in virtual reality.

## Desktop Panels

| **Ctrl-S** | Save                      |

### Collaboration

The collaboration screen is to help your team connect in FirstStage sessions. You can:

* See who else in your team is online and message them with voice or text notes.
* Enable or disable speech comms

### Sequencer

The Sequencer is a simple video editing tool that takes it's feed directly from the live cameras in the current FirstStage scene. You can:

* Add cameras to a Master timeline and trim when they start/stop to create a rough edit.
* Export the edit as a video file, or export all the camera footage to edit in the software of your choice.
