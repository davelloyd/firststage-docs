# Controls and Automation

There are three separate control desks on the [WristPad](wristpad/):&#x20;

* ****[**Lights**](controls-and-automation/lights.md)****
* ****[**Audio**](controls-and-automation/audio.md)****
* ****[**Stage Controls**](controls-and-automation/stage-machinery.md)****

&#x20;Each of these provides control strips for each thing in the scene of the appropriate type.

## Automation

Each control can be automated allowing it to change during the scene.&#x20;

The **Record Arm** button must be enabled or changes to controls will be immediate and will not be recorded.

If you scrub to a point in time and set the control, the value will be recorded in an Automation activity on the [Timeline](working-with-time/timeline.md). The control value will be interpolated between key points.

You can also ride a control while the scene is recording to record a live track that matches events in the scene.
