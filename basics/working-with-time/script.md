The Script provides an alternative view on the Timeline: it arranges activities vertically in order of when they start.&#x20;

Each activity is presented as a block with the color of the subject thing it is acting on. On the left, the start and stop times of the activity are shown.

A vertical black bar inside an activity indicates where the current time is by proportion through that activity.

The left hand shows a list of all the things with activities.
