# Motion Paths

Another way to navigate time is with motion paths: if you point at something that is animated, a stream of particles will appear and follow along the motion path.

If you point at the motion path, a tag will highlight showing the time when the thing is at that position on the path.

You can scrub time by pulling the trigger to grab the path and then point at where on the path you want to scrub to.
