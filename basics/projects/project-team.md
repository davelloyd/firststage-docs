# Project Team

Each project has a set of collaborators who can have access to this project. These are shown in a panel below the list of Scenes. The Project Team panel shows who they are for a project.

You can invite another user of FirstStage to a project by clicking on the Invite button: a dialog panel will pop up asking you to enter the user name.

## Removing a Project <a href="#_sd1n9qv4lu76" id="_sd1n9qv4lu76"></a>

To remove yourself from a project, click on the Remove Project button. This will only remove the project from your list, other collaborators will still be able to access the project.

If you are the only member of a project, you will instead see a Delete Project button. Clicking on this will remove you from the project and since there are no other collaborators, it will be deleted.
