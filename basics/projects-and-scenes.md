# Projects and Scenes

### The Office <a href="#_uuidrmik5m1t" id="_uuidrmik5m1t"></a>

When you start FirstStage, the Office is the first space you go to. You can choose to work with it in VR or from the Desktop.

### Projects <a href="#_6mxtsehwk8bf" id="_6mxtsehwk8bf"></a>

Projects are the top level organisation in FirstStage.

All of your projects are shown on the Projects panel in the Office. You can have multiple projects and each project can have a different set of collaborators.

Projects also own imported assets: an asset imported from Unity, or saved from within FirstStage must be assigned to one of your projects.

### Creating a Project <a href="#_5xg9fgr8yjfq" id="_5xg9fgr8yjfq"></a>

When you first enter the Office, you will probably have no projects (unless you have been invited into one by someone else).

To create a new Project, press the Create button. A dialog panel will pop up inviting you to give it a name. In VR, you can type out the name with the virtual keyboard and the mallets at the end of your controllers. On the desktop you can use the normal keyboard.

Click the green tick to complete the creation of the Project. (And click the red cross if you want to bail on creating a project.)

### Selecting a Project <a href="#_rfawbxbtx1jf" id="_rfawbxbtx1jf"></a>

To select a project, simply click on the Project name and the Project will open showing a list of the Scenes in the Project in the left hand column. The currently selected Scene is in the right hand column.

### Project Team <a href="#_iuwejzrr5fyk" id="_iuwejzrr5fyk"></a>

Each project has a set of collaborators who can have access to this project. These are shown in a panel below the list of Scenes. The Project Team panel shows who they are for a project.

You can invite another user of FirstStage to a project by clicking on the Invite button: a dialog panel will pop up asking you to enter the user name.

### Removing a Project <a href="#_sd1n9qv4lu76" id="_sd1n9qv4lu76"></a>

To remove yourself from a project, click on the Remove Project button. This will only remove the project from your list, other collaborators will still be able to access the project.

If you are the only member of a project, you will instead see a Delete Project button. Clicking on this will remove you from the project and since there are no other collaborators, it will be deleted.

### Scenes <a href="#_s02ygqevyapp" id="_s02ygqevyapp"></a>

Scenes are what FirstStage works with. A scene has a base stage on which things are placed. A number of stages are provided with FirstStage but more can imported for use in your projects. Examples of such stages include the Empty Stage (as its name suggests, a blank sheet for doing what you want) or the Theatre stage (a model of the Linz ToG theatre) or the Office and Police Station.

### Creating a Scene <a href="#_j65e2dkcypel" id="_j65e2dkcypel"></a>

Click on the Create button to create a new Scene. A dialog panel will pop up inviting you to give the scene a name and to select the stage it will use.

Click the green tick to complete the creation of the scene. (Or click the red cross to cancel.) The stage will then be loaded and the new scene will be ready to work on.

### Selecting a Scene <a href="#_9t8ddmg0hmvu" id="_9t8ddmg0hmvu"></a>

Click on a Scene in the list to select it. From the right hand panel, you can:

* Enter the Scene to work on it.
* Copy the Scene
* Delete the Scene

### Scene Comments <a href="#_vlikjvf16g4z" id="_vlikjvf16g4z"></a>

While working on a Scene, you and your colleagues can record comments including:

* Voice memos (with transcript via dictation)
* Camera snaphots
* Scribble

These comments are shown in a panel for the selected scene in a “chat” fashion with each comment showing the timestamp and contributor’s name as well as the content.
