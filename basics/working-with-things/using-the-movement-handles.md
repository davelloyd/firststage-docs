# Using the Movement Handles

The movement handles let you nudge something along one axis only and with precision. You can show the handles by selection **Movement Handles** from the Inspect Menu.

## Translate Handles

The Translate handles show up as arrows arranged along the edges of the box enclosing the target.

Grab the handle and a red ball will appear. Move the ball and the target will move in that direction only.

## Rotate Handles

The Rotate handles show up as circles in the middle of the sides of the box enclosing the target.

Grab the handle and a red ball will appear. Twist the ball and the target will rotate around that axis.

## Scale Handles

The Scale handles how up as corners around the box enclosing the target.

Grab the handle and the target will scale as you move the handle outwards from or inwards towards the target's centre.
