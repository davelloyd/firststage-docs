# Moving with the Waldo

The Waldo provides an alternative configuration of the movement handles directly in front of you allowing you to move things remotely. It can be particularly useful for placing large things like scenery, buildings etc.

A guide wire links the waldo to the target being moved.

### Choose Axis

A slide switch lets you choose which set of axes to move the target along:

| **World** (default) | The natural coordinates of the stage: north/south, east/west, up/down.    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Target**          | The local coordinates of the target: x, y, z.                             |
| **Local**           | The coordinates of the work area: forwards/backwards, left/right, up/down |

### Set Snap Factor

Slide switches let you set the linear snap and the angle snap.

**Linear snap** sets the grid size that coordinates will snap to under translation.

**Angular snap** sets the angular granularity that rotations will snap to.
