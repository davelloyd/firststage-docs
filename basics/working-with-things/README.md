# Working with Things

Whenever you grab an asset from the [Asset Library](../asset-library.md) and place it on set you create a new **Thing**. (We call them 'things' to distinguish from the many other types of 'objects' around.)

A stage may include things already placed: typically set dressing, furniture etc.&#x20;

We can pick things up with the [Grabber](../core-tools/grabber.md) (remote or proximity) and move them. This is a very fast way of laying out a set but it is not the most precise. You can also use the [movement handles](using-the-movement-handles.md) or the [waldo](moving-with-the-waldo.md).

We can also [multiply select](../core-tools/selector.md), [copy](../core-tools/duplicator.md) and [delete](../core-tools/destroyer.md) things.

## Inspect Menu

If you point at a thing and press and hold the Inspect button (Vive Menu button or Index/Oculus B button), the Inspect Wheel Menu will show. This has the following actions (depending on the properties of the thing):

| Hide Handles     | Hide any handles showing.                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Movement Handles | Show the movement handles.                               |
| Waldo            | Show the Waldo: remote controls for moving a thing.      |
| Scale Handles    | Show the scale handles for changing the size of a thing. |
| Start Motion     | Create a keyframe to start a motion path animation.      |
| Reset Pose       | Reset a character's pose to default.                     |
| Steer            | Create a steer path for a character to follow.           |
| Edit Shape       | Edit a sketch or procedural shape.                       |
