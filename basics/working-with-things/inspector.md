## Properties

| Lock        | When locked, a thing cannot be moved or destroyed.                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Physics     | When physics is enabled, the thing will fall under gravity and react to collisions.                                                                                                            |
| Mass        | The mass of the thing determiness how it reacts to collisions. A heavy thing colliding with a light thing will only be deflected a small amount while the light thing will be deflected a lot. |
| Bounciness  | How much something bounces when it hits something else.                                                                                                                                        |
| Friction    | The amount of friction when something is dragging against something else.                                                                                                                      |
| Walkable On | If a thing is walkable on, a character can walk on it - otherwise a character will walk through it.                                                                                            |
| Holdable    | If a thing is holdable, a performer can grab the thing when performing first-person.                                                                                                           |
| Image       | Some things have materials that can hold images. If so, there will be an entry here.                                                                                                           |

## Actions

| Show Now      | Hides the thing at start of time, and shows it now.                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Show          | Shows the thing now.                                                                        |
| Hide          | Hides the thing now.                                                                        |
| Record a note | Records a voice memo attached to the thing. Can be useful for informing other team members. |

## Renaming Things

If you point at the name of the thing, a couple of buttons will appear: the red cross simply removes the thing from the current selection; but the pencil allows you to rename the thing.

Pressing the rename button takes you to an inner space with a keyboard that you can use to type in a new name.

The form also appears on the desktop view of FirstStage allowing you to type with a real keyboard if you prefer.

## Multiple Selection

You can also change properties for many things at once, by selecting them with the [Selector](../core-tools/selector.md): all things selected will show at the top of the screen and the common properties shared by everything in the selection can be changed.
