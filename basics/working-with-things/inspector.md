## Properties

| Lock        | When locked, a thing cannot be moved or destroyed.                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Physics     | When physics is enabled, the thing will fall under gravity and react to collisions.                                                                                                            |
| Mass        | The mass of the thing determiness how it reacts to collisions. A heavy thing colliding with a light thing will only be deflected a small amount while the light thing will be deflected a lot. |
| Bounciness  | How much something bounces when it hits something else.                                                                                                                                        |
| Friction    | The amount of friction when something is dragging against something else.                                                                                                                      |
| Walkable On | If a thing is walkable on, a character can walk on it - otherwise a character will walk through it.                                                                                            |
| Holdable    | If a thing is holdable, a performer can grab the thing when performing first-person.                                                                                                           |
| Image       | Some things have materials that can hold images. If so, there will be an entry here.                                                                                                           |
