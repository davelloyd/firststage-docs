# Collaboration

In FirstStage, you don't have to work alone: you can work with several team members at once in the same scene. Anyone who is a member of your [project's team](projects/project-team.md) can join you.

## Cloud Collaboration

FirstStage stores everything in a repository on a server in the cloud. All changes to the scene are recorded there.&#x20;

Every change you make is sent to the repository and it is also broadcast to any of your team members who are also in the same scene.

The repository view of the scene is definitive: all team members should see the same scene.&#x20;

## Peer-to-peer Collaboration

FirstStage relies on peer-to-peer networking to allow team members to see each other and talk to each other live on-set.&#x20;

Once on-set together you should be able to see other team members' heads and hands and be able to talk to them using the mic & earphones built into your VR headset.

If you pick something up, your team members will see that thing floating about as you move it.

If you perform inside a puppet, your team members will see your performance in real-time.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Peer to peer connections can be unreliable depending on you and your other team members' firewalls and internet connections. (We use a technique known as [NAT punchthrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole\_punching\_\(networking\))).

We are working on a new improved networking solution which will not suffer from this problem.
