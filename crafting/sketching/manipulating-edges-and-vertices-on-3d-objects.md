# Manipulating Edges & Vertices on 3d Objects

#### Using distance and proximity grab

In FirstStage there is a Sketchup-style 3d modeller in VR.

See Sketching 3d Shapes to create an object. This guide covers the manipulation of vertices and edges, including free and grid-based movement, using distance grab and proximity grab.

You can manipulate 3d objects with one or two hands with distance grab or proximity grab.

**Distance grab**

1  Press the Menu button and select the Grabber tool in both hands

2  Point at the object, press the ThumbPad and select 'Edit Shape'.

3  To freely move a vertice, point at a corner, hold the trigger and move your hand

4  To freely move both vertices, point at two corners, hold both triggers and move your hands.

5  To move the edge on the object's axis, point at an edge, hold the trigger and move your hand.

6  To freely move the edge, click the Grip button to turn Snap to Grid off, then point at an edge, hold the trigger and move your hand.

All those actions can also be performed when grabbing the object in close proximity.\
There are also some specific proximity grab manipulations.

**Proximity grab**

7 - To scale the edge, move your hands within close proximity to the object, the grab an edge with both hands and move your hands apart

8 - To angle the edge, grab an edge again with both hands and move your hands about
