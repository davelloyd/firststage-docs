# Painting with Materials

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/zzoX7tmeAbU" %}

Most things in FirstStage are constructed from triangle meshes. Each mesh can have its own material and depending on how a thing is constructed it might have just the one material or many.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Some meshes respond to materials better than others. Much depends on the quality of the [uv mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV\_mapping) of the mesh when the original model was created.

Material painting works particularly well on [sketches](../sketching.md).

The **Paint Roller** tool lets you replace a material effectively painting in a flood fill style. Unlike the core tools, you won't find the Paint Roller on the [Tools Wheel Menu](../basics/core-tools/).&#x20;

Go to the **Materials** palette on the [WristPad](../basics/wristpad/) and click on one of the material balls: you will now be holding the Paint Roller with that material on the brush. The left hand column shows a list of tags: click on one to select materials with that tag. At the bottom of that list is a switch that lets you choose between spheres or cubes for demonstrating the materials.

Point the Paint Roller at a thing and click the trigger to paint it with that material.

**Plain Color** allows you to choose a color from a palette along with the gloss and metallic/plasticness of the material. On the right is a list of saved colors and you can save the current material to the list with the **+** button.

The eyedropper tool is another special tool that lets you pick a color from any other thing by pointing at it and clicking .
