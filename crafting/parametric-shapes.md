# Parametric Shapes

In the [Asset Library](../basics/asset-library.md), you will find a variety of parametric shapes under the **Shape** tag. You can enable additional handles by choosing the **Edit Shape** option on the [Inspect Menu](broken-reference).

## Cylinder Section

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/DUMMY 2023-02-14 21-13-28.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Grab the inside to change the inner radius
* Grab the outside to change the outer radius
* Grab the top or bottom to extend
* Grab the ends to extend the arc of the section

You can also change how the shape is constructed from the [Inspector](../basics/working-with-things/inspector.md):

| **Facets** | How many facets to subdivide the curved surface into. |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

## Sphere Section

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/DUMMY 2023-02-14 21-17-09.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Grab the outside to change the outer radi
* Grab the inside to change the inner radius
* Grab one of the edges to change the sweep angle (either latitude or longitude)

## Curved Wall

* Grab the spline knots to control the curve of the wall
* Grab the top to change the height
* Grab a side to change the thickness

## Bendable Pole

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/DUMMY 2023-02-14 21-23-41.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Grab the spline knots to control the curve of the pole
* Grab with two hands to change the thickness of the pole&#x20;

## Stairs

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/DUMMY 2023-02-14 21-21-51.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Grab the spline knots to control the curve of the stairs
* Grab the sides to change the offset from the curve
* Grab the top of the top stair to change the height of the stairs
* Grab the top of the bottom stair to change the height of each step
* Grab the from of a step to change the step length
