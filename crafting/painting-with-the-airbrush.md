# Painting with the Airbrush

You can do detailed painting with the **Airbrush** on [sketches](../sketching.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
EXPERIMENTAL! The Airbrush only works on sketches on faces that have not been painted with a material. It does not yet work with imported models. Paintings with too many brush strokes may cause FirstStage to slow down. We intend to improve this in a later release.
{% endhint %}

Go to the **Paint** palette on the [WristPad](../basics/wristpad/) and click on the ink pad: you will then have the Airbrush in your hand loaded with that color ink.

The main panel lets you choose a color by pointing and clicking (or hold & drag to continuously change the color). By default it shows a spectrum with hue left/right and saturation up/down. You can change brightness with the vertical slider next to it.&#x20;

You can change the type of spectrum by clicking the R, G, B, H, S, V buttons to select which has the slider and which are in the panel.

The eyedropper tool is another special tool that lets you pick a color from any other thing by pointing at it and clicking .

The right hand column shows saved colors and you can save the current color by clicking on the **+** button.

Point at a face on a sketch (that hasn't had a material painted on) and you'll see a circle around the end of your beam which shows the size of your brush.&#x20;

Pull the trigger to paint the face: the density of the paint varies depending on how much you squeeze the trigger.&#x20;

You can increase or decrease the brush size by using the thumbpad or thumbstick.

You can change between different brush patterns by going to the **Brushes** tab on the Paint palette.
