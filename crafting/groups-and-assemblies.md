# Groups and Assemblies

It is often easiest to construct something from a collection of different shapes. Grouping them together makes the move and behave as a single thing.

[Select](../basics/core-tools/selector.md) the things you want to group and go to the [Inspector](../basics/working-with-things/inspector.md) and press the **Group** button.&#x20;

Once grouped, you may want to [rename](../basics/working-with-things/inspector.md#renaming-things) it to something more helpful.

Groups behave as most other things: you can copy, destroy, animate them, etc.

## Assemblies

You may want to re-use particular groups in other scenes. Assemblies are basically groups that are save to the Asset Repository.

You can save a group as an assembly by going to the Inspector and pressing the **Save As Assembly** button.

In fact, assemblies don't have to come from groups: you can save a single shape (or any other thing) as an assembly.
