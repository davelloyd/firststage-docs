# Images

Images can be very useful: either as a component in a larger assembly or as a reference while working in the scene.

You can put an image in a scene by going into the [Asset Library](../basics/asset-library.md) and selecting **Import Local Asset**. You can navigate the file system from a few familiar roots such as **C:\\** or **Pictures** and follow the directories down. Around you are the images in the current directory:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-02-14 233618.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Select any of these to place them on set.
