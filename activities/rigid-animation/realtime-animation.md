# Realtime Animation

As well as creating an animation from a sequence of keyframes, you can also use your controller to capture a rigid animation in realtime.

Select the [Animator](../../basics/core-tools/animator.md) tool: this works similarly to the Grabber but records the motion in realtime.

When you grab something with the Animator, a confirmation timer will show before recording of the animation starts. Keep holding the trigger to start.

You can then move the thing with your hand: it will follow as if on a tight spring which helps reduce hand jitter and results in a cleaner motion.

Release the trigger to finish the animation. Recording will stop and a new activity will appear on the timeline. Play back and it will now animate along the motion path created.

Scaling yourself bigger is beneficial for moving objects further distances, whilst scaling smaller is suited better for moving fine details such as peoples limbs to complete an action.
